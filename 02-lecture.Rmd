# Lecture

The exercises for this lecture revolves around line search methods.
The first exercise is to implement steepest descent.

## Steepest descent

```{r}
# First we need a function that we want to minimize
f <- function (x) {x^2 + 2*x + 3}
# We also need the gradient of the function
g <- function(x) {2*x + 2}

# Then we can implement steepest descent for this function
steepest_descent <- function (x_0, alpha = 0.1, obj_func = f, obj_grad = g, max_it = 100) {
  #First we plot the function in an arbitrary interval
  curve(f, -3, 4)
  # Insert the initial point in the plot
  points(x_0, f(x_0))
  # And set our x_k equal to the x_0
  x_k <- x_0
  for (i in 1:max_it) {
    # Then we find the steepest descent direction
    p_k <- -obj_grad(x_k)
    # We take a step of length alpha in the direction just found
    x_k <- x_k + alpha * p_k
    # Evaluate the function at this x_k
    f_k <- obj_func(x_k)
    # And plot our new position
    points(x_k, f_k)
  }
}

#The steepest descent implementation with x_0 = 4
steepest_descent(4)
```
